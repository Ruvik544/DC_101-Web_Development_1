        [Verse 1]<br>
        Uptown girl<br>
        She's been living in her uptown world<br>
        I bet she's never had a backstreet guy<br>
        I bet her momma never told her why<br>
        I'm gonna try for an<br>
<br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        Uptown girl<br>
        She's been living in her white-bred world<br>
        As long as anyone with hot blood can<br>
        And now, she's looking for a downtown man<br>
        That's what I am<br>
        <br>
        [Bridge]<br>
        And when she knows what she wants from her time<br>
        And when she wakes up and makes up her mind<br>
<br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        She'll see I'm not so tough<br>
        Just because I'm in love with an<br>
<br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        Uptown girl<br>
        You know I've seen her in her uptown world<br>
        She's getting tired of her high class toys<br>
        And all the presents from her uptown boys<br>
        She's got a choice<br>
<br>
        [Verse 3]<br>
        Uptown girl<br>
        You know I can't afford to buy her pearls<br>
        But maybe, someday, when my ship comes in<br>
        She'll understand what kind of guy I've been<br>
        And then I'll win<br>
<br>
        [Bridge]<br>
        And when she's walking, she's looking so fine<br>
        And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine<br>
<br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        She'll say I'm not so tough<br>
        Just because I'm in love with an<br>
<br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        Uptown girl<br>
        She's been living in her white-bred world<br>
        As long as anyone with hot blood can<br>
        And now, she's looking for a downtown man<br>
        That's what I am<br>
<br>
        [Outro]<br>
        Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl<br>
        You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl<br>
        You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl<br>
        You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl<br>
        You know I'm in love with an uptown girl<br>
